# Pragmatic Programmer Challenges


### Chapter 1

# How do you react when someone—such as a bank teller, an auto mechanic, 
# or a clerk—comes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them 
# and their company as a result?

- I consider myself very patient. If my order comes out wrong I consider
it a chance to try new things. If my car has blown a head gasket I'm ready
to take the bus for a while. That said, on the rare occasion that someone
bullshits me I get pissed off. About a year or a little longer ago I was 
having a couple drinks with a friend at a bar. When it came time to get the
check we discovered that we where charged for double the number of drinks
that we ordered. No problem, simple fix. However, when we brought this 
inconsistency up to the server we where met with an eye-roll and begrudging
help. Not great, but when we received the bill a second time the erroneous 
drinks where removed but two new mysterious charges had appeared. Now a 
pattern was forming. We eventually got the bill sorted out but our tip 
reflected our service and I have never been back to that same bar.
